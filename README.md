# Ultimate Comics Scraper

### Project Aims:

* Simple tool to build a database of all popular webcomics - that is multithreaded and works even on bad networks
* Simple HTML page that lets you view all comics in a sequential/ random manner with all the original info

### Project Todos:
* Locally storing comics that have been downloaded already and the related information (like author, alt text etc)
* Making a page that lets viewers browse comics at convenience


### Why I'm making this

I've found several webcomic scraper on the internet - but  **not even a single one was usable ** - they just dumped images, didn't account for timeouts or have any error handling. Most of them would crash halfway and were extremely slow.
Worse, there wasn't any good way for browsing the comics. Valuable extra jokes like XKCD's alt text were lost.
